This project was developed as part of the Programming Languages 1 course assignment.

Project Description:

VocabularyApp is a desktop application designed for users to practice English-Turkish vocabulary. Users can create and manage their own word lists, track learned words, and perform practice sessions where the application checks their translations and presents incorrect answers again to reinforce learning. Admin users can access a management panel to view and manage other users. The application was developed using C# and the .NET Framework, with Windows Forms (WinForms) providing the graphical user interface.
